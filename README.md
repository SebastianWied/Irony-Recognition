# Irony-Recognition
My dissertation research regarding acoustic cues for irony in spontaneous speech and deep learning approaches to naturalistic irony classification. Specific details can be found in each directory's README file.

1)  Acoustic feature extraction is performed using the scripts in the AcousticFeatureExtraction directory.

2)  Irony-annotated WAV files are stored in the AudioData directory.

3)  Scripts for inferential statistics and deep learning experiments are in the FeaturalAnalysis directory.

4)  Model implementations for the deep learning models are in the Models directory.

5)  Pre-annotation audio preparation scripts can be found in the preAnnotation directory.

6)  R code for inferential statistics can be found in the Rcode directory.
